# Product Experience – React Frontend Challenge

This project is a **narrative-driven product showcase** built as part of a React.js frontend challenge.  
Instead of a traditional e-commerce grid, the interface focuses on **storytelling, interaction, and visual hierarchy** to present four core products in a modern, immersive way.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend design thinking alongside clean React implementation.  
Each product is treated as a **distinct moment** rather than a static listing, guiding the user through a visually engaging experience.

The application is fully frontend-only and optimized for clarity, interaction, and responsiveness.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The interface is intentionally designed around the following principles:

- **Narrative over catalog**  
  Products are presented as part of a visual story instead of a standard grid-based layout.

- **Visual hierarchy & rhythm**  
  Uneven card sizing, staggered positioning, and spacing are used to guide attention and create interest.

- **Progressive disclosure**  
  Detailed product information is revealed via a bottom-sheet modal, keeping the main layout clean and focused.

- **Subtle interactions**  
  Hover states, transitions, and animations are intentionally minimal to enhance usability without distraction.

---

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)** – Modern React architecture and optimized rendering
- **React + TypeScript** – Component-driven development with strong type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for rapid layout experimentation and custom designs
- **Static Product Data** – Product content is stored locally to keep the focus on frontend experience
- **CSS Animations** – Lightweight slide-up and slide-down animations for modal interactions

No backend services or external APIs are used, as the challenge emphasizes **UI/UX and frontend craftsmanship**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Non-traditional, staggered two-row product layout  
- Responsive design across screen sizes  
- Interactive product cards with hover states  
- Bottom-sheet style modal that slides up from the bottom  
- Smooth open and close animations for enhanced UX
